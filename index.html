    <h1>FireDude123's awesome site of awesomeness</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm FireDude123. I make websites, video games, and other bits & bobs. Check out some of my stuff:</p>
    <a href="https://f1redude123.github.io/Spinning-Rat-Simulator">Spinning Rat Simulator(not the one you think lol)</a>
    <a href="https://f1redude123.github.io/Spieler">Spieler - web-based game engine(UNFINISHED)</a>
    <a href="https://f1redude123.github.io/Vecter">Vecter demo - Check out the GitHub repo!</a>
    <a href="https://f1redude123.github.io/Vecter/docs/digmake.html">Digmake - Minecraft, but only one chunk, and no textures, and the buffer rotation is broken, and there are no mobs, and there's no player, and there's nothing at all really except a camera and a few inefficiently drawn blocks. Made with Vecter!</a>
    <p>I hope you enjoy perusing my collection!</p>
